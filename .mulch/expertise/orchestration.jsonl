When parallel builders create independent copies of shared deps, expect merge conflicts.

Always run typecheck immediately after merge. In this case, branding palette constants were dropped from output.ts because the standards builder branched pre-branding and auto-resolve picked the wrong hunk for the file header.","classification":"tactical","recorded_at":"2026-02-24T16:10:56.998Z","id":"mx-153dbf"}

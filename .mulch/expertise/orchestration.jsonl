{"type":"pattern","name":"parallel-builder-merge","description":"For greenfield CLI builds: decompose into 2-3 leads with non-overlapping file areas. When parallel builders create independent copies of shared deps, expect merge conflicts. Auto-resolve works but run quality gates after — API mismatches require fixup.","classification":"tactical","recorded_at":"2026-02-23T15:58:52.461Z","id":"mx-95851e"}

{"type":"decision","title":"Merge order matters for parallel builders","rationale":"Most complete builder first so auto-resolve keeps full implementations over stubs. Tests branch last since it depends on source existing.
